        <h2>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Alena Pearson</span></h2>
        <p>
          I’m currently a second-year student in the Multimedia Production program at 
          <strong>Lethbridge College</strong>, where I focus on graphic design, photography, 
          and web development. Throughout the program, I’ve learned how much I enjoy creating 
          visuals—whether that’s designing logos, editing photos, or building websites from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love combining creativity with technology. Web development has quickly become one 
          of my favourite areas to explore, especially when it comes to creating clean, 
          user-friendly designs that bring ideas to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduation, I hope to continue working in digital design and front-end development, 
          helping small businesses build their branding, share their stories, 
          and express their identity through strong visuals.
        </p>
